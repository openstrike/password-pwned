=head1 NAME

Password::Policy::Exception::PwnedError - Die if the password pwned API is unreachable

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Password::Policy;
    use Try::Tiny;

    my $pass = 'password1';

    my $pp = Password::Policy->new (config => 'policy.yaml');
    try {
        $pp->process({ password => $pass });
    } catch {
        warn "This password '$pass' is pwned - don't use it";
        # Other actions
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This exception is thrown when L<Password::Policy::Rule::Pwned>
cannot determine whether or not a password has been pwned. The
determination depends on a remote service which may not be available for
any number of reasons.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 error

    $exception->error ();

This method is not expected to be called directly but rather via
C<Password::Policy-E<gt>process>. It returns the text of an appropriate
error which in this case is "Invalid response checking for pwned password".

=head1 SEE ALSO

For how to determine if passwords are pwned, see
L<Password::Policy::Rule::Pwned>.

To understand how to use this as part of a wider password policy
enforcement program, see L<Password::Policy>.
