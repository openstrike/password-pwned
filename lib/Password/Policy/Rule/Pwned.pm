=head1 NAME

Password::Policy::Rule::Pwned - Check passwords haven't been pwned

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Password::Policy;
    use Try::Tiny;

    my $pass = 'password1';

    my $pp = Password::Policy->new (config => 'policy.yaml');
    try {
        $pp->process({ password => $pass });
    } catch {
        warn "This password '$pass' is pwned - don't use it";
        # Other actions
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plug this rule into L<Password::Policy> to validate potential passwords
against the list from L<api.pwnedpasswords.com>. It uses the recoomended
range function to ensure that neither the password nor its full hash is
ever transferred over the wire.

The Password::Policy configuration file should set the "pwned" attribute
to 1 in any policy where this rule should apply. A trivial example of
such a policy might be:

    ---
    default:
        length: 8
        algorithm: "Plaintext"
        pwned: 1

As with all other L<Password::Policy::Rule> types, this will throw an
exception to indicate an unsafe password. As it relies on a network
service to operate it will also throw an exception if the service is
unavailable for whatever reason. The two exceptions are different and
may be interrogated to determine the difference.

    try {
        $pp->process({ password => $pass });
    } catch {
        if (/has been pwned/) {
            warn "This password '$pass' is pwned - don't use it";
        } elsif (/Invalid response/) {
            warn "Could not check if password is pwned - use at own risk";
        } else {
            warn "Password not pwned but still bad: $_";
        }
        # Other actions
    }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 check

    $rule->check ($clearpw);

This method is not expected to be called directly but rather via
C<Password::Policy-E<gt>process>. It takes one argument which is the
password to be checked. If the password is a utf-8 string it must be
encoded first.

The method will throw a L<Password::Policy::Exception::Pwned> exception
if the password is pwned. If the API server is unavailable it will warn
and then throw a L<Password::Policy::Exception::PwnedError> exception. It
will return true if the password is verifiably not pwned.

=head1 STATUS

B<This is beta quality software.> It has been tested and may be used at
your own risk. The details of the implementation and interface may yet
be changed in future releases.
